# BackTableFinalProject
The Back Table's Final Project


Sean, Drew, Connor, Zak, and Emily
For our final project, we have made a "World Search" where you can enter
in the name of any country in the world and you will get back lots of information about it. 
For version 1.0 (Iteration 1) You can only search from the command line, to run the program simply run the class in Main and enter the country you want data on.

For version 2.0 (Iteration 2) You can still only search from the command line, however it now supports country comparisons, random country, and a battle between four countries. Just enter the countries you want for each category. 

For version 3.0 (Iteration 3) You can use an interactive Graphic User Interface using all functions from previous Iterations from the project except for random comparisons. To run the UI simply go to View -> Tool Windows -> Gradle -> Application -> Right Click and Run

We would like to give credit to the https://github.com/HanSolo/worldfx repo, as we have heavily used it as a basis for our GUI.
